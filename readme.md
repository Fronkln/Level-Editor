This is a work in progress level editor for My Friend Pedro.
You can take a look at it for yourself and maybe improve on it

If you use any of this code the only requirement is that Jhrino and Aevo is credited

DnSpy decompile and recompile is weird so you'll see stuff like gameObject7

Big thanks to Aevo for implementing the new improved saving system.
